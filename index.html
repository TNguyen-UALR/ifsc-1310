    <h2>Thoughts on Accessibility</h3>
    <section class="response">
      <p>Web Accessibility is an important and likely underimplemented area in most websites. The idea of web accessibility is to allow people with disability to access websites and pages on the internet without much issue.
        For example, the visually impaired may need a page magnifier, reader, or speech activated assistant so they are not forced to have someone else beside them at all times. I imagine it can be difficult to think that 
        because of a disability, some if not most activites, entertainment, and information are now out of your reach. Instead of being stuck with that idea, a little more thought and effort could be put into audience 
        accessibility so no one feels like their disability keeps them from what they are looking for.

    <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h3>
    <section class="response">
      <p>Progressive enhancement is a simple, interesting, and user-friendly approach to web development. It promotes the idea of 
        developing in layers that are able to be stripped away without any major impact to its original intented experience. The 
        average development cycle is to create everything, perhaps improve on it if its possible or neccessary, but then to ultimately 
        copy it to other platforms and try to make it all fit the same way regardless of drop in performance or care for the various 
        technologies that can access it. It is much better to prioritize the "message" and functionality of your content over pretty 
        looks that may not work at all on another device you hadn't thought much of during development time.

    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
    <section class="response">
      <h3>Feedback and Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Home page's pictures and descriptions for them are small. The buttons for Home, History etc are small 
        and floating there with no style consistency. The FAQ page, being the longest one because of its wordiness 
        is a bit of a scroll. It was not noticed until I tested the alternate screen sizes but the pages broke even 
        if the width was just a bit smaller than the original size.</p>
      <h3>What were the things you did well?</h2>
      <p>I was able to fix the mistakes that I was aware of when putting things together, even if it is a beginner 
        level approach of seeing a better option and using it anywhere I can. Obviously I still don't fully understand 
        how to do many things that might look hard but in truth are easy and vice-versa, however I have been able to 
        notice the behaviors of existing websites' graphics and can see that a multitude of "simple" things can appear 
        as if its complicated to make.</p>
      <h3>What would you do differently if you had to startover?</h2>
      <p>If I had to start over I would probably look into custom graphics and using more references to see if I 
        could replicate or manipulate them to my needs. My original design choices were really simple and basic 
        so I would definitely have tried to make things more themed and visually cohesive through each page and 
        part of it in the next go-around. The main target of my second study would have to be fully understanding 
        how to manipulate what's on the page and getting a sense of too much or too little in terms of visual design.</p>
      <h3>Also report on the feedback you received and what you did to address those issues or why you chose not to make the recommended changes.</h2>
      <p>I did start by adjusting the sizes of things to go by percent instead of pixel, which was a simple yet very satisfying solution to my 
        "crowding" problem whenever the width of the page changed. After that, I wanted to address the lengthiness of the FAQ page, so I put 
        each question and answer into details for the users that may want to see a particular question's answer and not have to scroll through 
        an endless amount paragraphs without at least a table of contents for each question.</p>
