      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>SpaceX began developing the Dragon spacecraft in late 2004, making a public announcement in 2006 with a plan of entering service in 2009. 
        Also in 2006, SpaceX won a contract to use the Dragon spacecraft for commercially supplied resupply services to the International Space 
        Station for the American federal space agency, NASA.</p>

      <p>During its maiden flight in December 2010, Dragon became the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to be recovered successfully 
        from orbit. On 25 May 2012, a cargo variant of Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to successfully rendezvous with and attach to 
        the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX is contracted to deliver cargo to the ISS under NASA's Commercial Resupply Servicesprogram, 
        and Dragon began regular cargo flights in October 2012.  With the Dragon spacecraft and the Orbital ATK Cygnus, NASA seeks to increase its 
        partnerships with domestic commercial aviation and aeronautics industry.</p>
      <p>On 3 June 2017, the CRS-11 capsule largely assembled from previously flown components from the CRS-4 mission in September 2014 was launched 
        again for the first time, with the hull, structural elements, thrusters, harnesses, propellant tanks, plumbing and many of the avionics reused 
        while the heat shield, batteries and components exposed to sea water upon splashdown for recovery were replaced.</p>
